# Github Default Monospace Font

GitHub configures a few different mono-space fonts for blocks on code on it's site; and while they look good, if you have a personal favourite font configured in your browser then you don't get to see it on there.

This extension adds CSS to GitHub to force it to use your web browsers configured mono-space font.

You can find this extension on the Chrome Extension Store at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-default-monospace-font/cecgkkiondgofabejglnpgfgkbpkdbgp
